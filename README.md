Development Requirements:
==========
On Mac or Linux (Windows hasn't been used to date)

0. Install nodejs, see: https://github.com/joyent/node
1. Install meteor, see: docs.meteor.com
2. Make sure you have a local mongodb instance to use or get a test one at mongohq.com
3. Sublime2 is the preferred text editor of this project

To Run Locally:
============

0. From the project's root dir: 'meteor run' (optionally specifying a port and mongodb url)
1. If you didn't specify a port, open up Google Chrome to localhost:3000
2. Profit!

To Deploy to Production:
============

	Coming soon (once we have a prod server, e.g. Rackspace)...

To Deploy to Test:
============

	Coming soon (once we have a test server, e.g. Rackspace)...

	OR, you could use 'meteor deploy rustythetestdog.meteor.com' to temporary testing. Beware: that will deploy your instance to the public web, so anyone can see all your sekrets!
